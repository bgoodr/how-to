python_preamble_basic
=====================

[Parent README](../README.md)

Basic Python script executed from a "preamble" Bash script. This
serves multiple purposes:

- Allow the script to be executed directly from the users command line
  without using the .py extension.

- Provide notes on working around Emacs pdb bugs.

- Demonstrate examples of basic Python coding practices in
  [non_module_python_script.py](non_module_python_script.py).

This does not have any module .py files in this directory.

Usage
=====

Execute it:

    cd into_this_directory
    ./non_module_python_script some_value

You should see this output:

    some value
